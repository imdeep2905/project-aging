global:

1. It is not a good practice to redefine functions (migration). Restructure and move common functions in a different file.
2. Convert whole thing into a CLI. Just give options (e.g. raw_convert, migrate, etc.)

raw_converter:

1.  Make default timezone dynamic - maybe a command line argument?
2.  Standardize input/output (i.e. in and out folders).
3.  Validate and use gps_timestamp and gps_datestamp.
